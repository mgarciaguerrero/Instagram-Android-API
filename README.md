instagram-android-api
========

Android wrapper for the Instagram API (Work in progress...)

## How to install

### 1. Add a dependency

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```gradle
allproject{
    repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add the following dependency to your build.gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.mgarciaguerrero:Instagram-Android-API:0.0.1'
}
```

You can also do it manually, by downloading the source code, importing the `library` folder as an Android Library Module, and adding a dependency on your project to that module.

## How to use

### 1. Register Your Application

To get started, you will need to register an application with Instagram. They will provide you with a client id, and a client secret. They will additionally ask you for a callback URL. This is simply a URL that your browser will redirect back to during the Instagram Auth flow.

### 2. Set up your application

On your application class, use this snippet:
```java
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        //Init InstagramManager with context application
        InstagramManager.init(getApplicationContext());
    }
```

### 3. Set up your manifest
```xml
    <application>
        ...
        <meta-data
            android:name="instagram.ClientId"
            android:value="YOUR_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="instagram.ClientSecret"
            android:value="YOUR_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET" />
        <meta-data
            android:name="instagram.RedirectUrl"
            android:value="YOUR_INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URL" />
    </application>
```
